# swarm-behaviour
using java's swing library a model of some complex swarm behaviour has been created

Some moving objects with determined vision area spawn with random velocity and position.
 - They try to get closer to other objects they see
 - They move away if they are too close
 - They try to allign their velocity vector with others
 - They can't go through obstacles
